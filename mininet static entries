It's now time to start an emulated network of stratum_bmv2 switches. To start the topology, used the following command:
$make start
This command will start two Docker containers, one for mininet and one for ONOS.
Added an NDP entry to h1, mapping h2's IPv6 address (2001:1:1::b) to its MAC address (00:00:00:00:00:B):
mininet> h1 ip -6 neigh replace 2001:1:1::B lladdr 00:00:00:00:00:B dev h1-eth0
And vice versa, add an NDP entry to h2 to resolve h1's address
